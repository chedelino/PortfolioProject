# PortfolioProject

This repository contains all the projects I have worked on or am currently working on. I keep it update as much as possible. The projects are in SQL, Python (Jupyter Notebook) and R (R markdown). Click on the projects to see full analysis, codes and raw data.

## Projects :

### 1- [Covid19 Data Exploration in SQL](https://github.com/chedelino/PortfolioProject/tree/main/Covid19%20Data%20Exploration%20in%20SQL)

Drawing on the Our World in Data organization's Covid19 dataset, this project provides an overview of the scope of the Covid19 in Haiti. The results shed light on both the total cases, total deaths, death percentage, infection rate and the percentage of vaccinated people.



### 2- [Nashville_Housing Data Cleaning](https://github.com/chedelino/PortfolioProject/tree/main/Nashville_Housing%20Data%20Cleaning)

Nothing helps to boost a decision-making process like clean data.
Inaccurate data can be dangerous, as it leads to false conclusions, making even the most sophisticated algorithm fail. 

That's why data cleaning is so important because it removes incorrect, wrongly formatted, and incomplete data within a dataset. In this project, I will be practicing some of the most common data cleaning techniques in SQL. 



### 3- [Covid19 Dashboard in Tableau](https://github.com/chedelino/PortfolioProject/tree/main/Covid19%20Dashboard)

Using data from my previous project [Covid19 Data Exploration in SQL](https://github.com/chedelino/PortfolioProject/tree/main/Covid19%20Data%20Exploration%20in%20SQL), this dashboard helps us get a clear idea of what the information found means, and provides an accessible way to see and understand the patterns in the data by using visual elements such as charts, graphs, and maps.
