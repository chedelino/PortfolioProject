This repository contains all the projects I have worked on or am currently working on. I keep it update as much as possible. The projects are in SQL, Python (Jupyter Notebook) and R (R markdown). Click on the projects to see full analysis, code and raw data.

## Projects:

### 1- [Covid19 Data Exploration in SQL](https://github.com/chedelino/PortfolioProject/tree/main/Covid19%20Data%20Exploration%20in%20SQL)

Drawing on the Our World in Data organization's Covid19 dataset, this project provides an overview of the scope of the Covid19 in Haiti. The results shed light on both the total cases, total deaths, and the number of fully vaccinated people.
